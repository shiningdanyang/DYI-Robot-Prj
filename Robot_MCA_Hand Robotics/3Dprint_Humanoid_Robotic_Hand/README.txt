# Summary

The hand files are part of a larger project which has taken around two years. The project is an entirely 3D printed humanoid robot similar to the inmoov project but with many major differences in design. It features an improved gripping design and an opposable thumb. This is created to be incredibly inexpensive, simple to make, and reliable, I have put the arm through some rigorous stress testing, and it's able to run for hours on end without a hitch. I will publish the rest of the arm designs in the near future. My current goal is to gain funding through sponsorship or donations to continue my research.
Assembly of the arm is very simple and forthright but I will post a video on how to assemble the arm very soon (the order in which you assemble is crucial).

Materials needed for the arm:
-Flexible Nylon Paracord: http://www.paracordplanet.com/black-1-8-shock-cord/?gclid=CjwKEAjwoPG8BRCSi5uu6d6N5WcSJABHzD8F0L0fHDhT_dqwNNAAP0UubP1OmgCBMNTkp_OyXJ0xuBoC05Tw_wcB
-Standard sized servos x5 (these are the servos I used but any standard sized servo will work well):   https://www.banggood.com/Towerpro-MG958-55g-20KG-High-Torque-Digital-Metal-Gear-Servo-p-978254.html?rmmds=search 
-Micro servo: https://www.amazon.com/TowerPro-MG90S-Geared-Helicopter-Trex450/dp/B01F7MRR38/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1493004060&sr=8-7&keywords=micro+servo+metal+gear
-Fishing line between .5mm and .8mm      *you can get this anywhere*


Tools needed for assembly:
-Super Glue
-Plyers
-Screwdriver
-Exacto Knife or Scissors







CODING:

My partner in this project who deals with all the programming just recently published all the files on how to control the arm with the LEAP on his gifthub page-----

This code, in particular, is what took us many months to perfect so I sincerely hope you guys enjoy using it!
